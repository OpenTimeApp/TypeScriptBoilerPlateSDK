#TypeScript BoilerPlate SDK

### What is this repository for?

This is boilerplate for a Typescript SDK with unit test support.
 
### How can I create SDK?

Simply create .ts files in the `sdk` folder and write your typescript code. Put your unit tests into the `tests` folder.

Note: when you import classes you should specify relative path. Please see the examples in this boilerplate

### How to install
* Download or clone this repo.
* Run `npm install`

Note: sometimes in WebStorm IDE typings for jasmine aren't indexed for some reason for the first time. You may need to restart your IDE to see the effect.

### How to use
* `npm test` or `karma start` - will run tests that are in the `tests` folder. It will also enable file watcher, so after each saved change you make tests will rerun automatically.
* `karma start --single-run` - will run tests once.
* For IDEA-based IDE's (like WebStorm) right click on the `karma.conf.js` file and in the context menu select `Run karma.conf.js`.
